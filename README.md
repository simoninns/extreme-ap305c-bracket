# Extreme-AP305C-Bracket

## Overview

A 3D printable bracket for the Extreme Networks AP305C, AP410C and AP510C (aka Aerohive AP650) access points.

The bracket provides two mounting points for wall or ceiling mounting using two screws which should be 3mm in diameter with 6mm flat heads.

The bracket can also be used as a desk stand.  Attach 4x 8mm 3M Bump-on feet to the 4 marked areas to keep the bracket steady and prevent surface damage.  When used as a desk stand the bracket does not cover the console cable connector on the base of the access point.

## Print settings

The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using PETG filament. All parts fit on a 20x20 printing bed.

* Material: PETG
* Layer: 0.20mm (Quality)
* Infill: 15%
* Supports: Support on build plate only
* Print time (approximate): 1h 52m


## Assembly

Place each one of the lever bumps into the lever recess sideways through the provided gap.  Twist lever bump through 90 degrees.  The bump should lock into place.  This is easier if you use a pair of small flat-nosed pliers (be careful not to squeeze the pieces too hard when handling with the pliers).
